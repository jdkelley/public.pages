If you would like an easy way to use Slack to handle a project's team messaging, notes, attachments, etc., then start by creating a new Slack project channel or go to an existing project channel. (If you make a new project channel, use the associated referenceId in the channel title)

**Example: 112233-proj_title**

Then invite @wf to the channel

**Example: /invite @wf**

In addition, if @wf doesnâ€™t know you, she will nag you when you post to associate yourself with a Workfront account.

**Example: /wf set user sbachman@samaritan.org** (If prompted, associates your slack account with the approriate Workfront Account.
